🔍 RAG Pipeline (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) A RAG pipeline combines a retriever and a generator to answer user queries based on external documents. The retriever fetches relevant content from a knowledge base (e.g., PDFs, websites), and the generator (like a language model) creates accurate, context-aware responses.
