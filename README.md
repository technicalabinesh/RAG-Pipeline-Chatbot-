🧠 RAG Pipeline Chatbot using n8n
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Chatbot using n8n, the powerful open-source workflow automation platform. It combines context-aware question answering with real-time document retrieval, enabling smarter and more accurate AI-powered conversations — ideal for use cases like customer support, internal documentation bots, product assistants, and more.

🔍 What is RAG?
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a hybrid AI approach that enhances large language models (LLMs) by combining:

Retrieval: Fetching relevant documents from external sources (e.g., Notion, Google Docs, PDF files, APIs, or databases).

Generation: Using an LLM (like OpenAI, Gemini, or Hugging Face) to generate a response based on the retrieved context.

Unlike traditional chatbots, RAG ensures factual accuracy by grounding answers in real data.

⚙️ How It Works (Using n8n)
This chatbot is built as an n8n workflow, leveraging its no-code/low-code capabilities to create a flexible and modular architecture:

Trigger Node

Accepts input from users via Webhook, Telegram, Discord, or web form.

Text Preprocessing

Optional steps to clean or reformat the user input.

Embedding & Retrieval

User query is converted into a vector using an embedding model (OpenAI, Cohere, or Google embeddings).

Search against a vector database (like Qdrant, Pinecone, or Weaviate) to retrieve the most relevant documents.

Context Construction

Top results are compiled into a prompt format with instructions for the LLM.

LLM Generation

A language model (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4, Gemini 1.5, or Hugging Face models) generates a response based on the query and retrieved context.

Response Delivery

The final answer is sent back to the user through the same communication channel.

🛠️ Setup Guide
Clone the repository and install n8n.

Import the chatbot-workflow.json into n8n.

Configure:

API keys for LLMs and vector databases

Data sources (Notion, Google Docs, CSV, etc.)

Deploy and start the workflow.

Connect to your preferred chat interface.

💡 Tips
You can schedule data ingestion workflows in n8n to keep your knowledge base up to date.

Use n8n's built-in credential manager for secure API integration.

Try chunking large documents and indexing them for better retrieval accuracy.
